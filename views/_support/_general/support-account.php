<p class="intro">Sometimes it's neccessary to create a user account to help with product support. However it's dangerous to give out an admin account to just anyone since this increases the liklihood of security issues.</p>

<p class="note">We will always keep your information safe, and will only ever use your information to help fix the problems you are having, however it's still worth keeping your website safe in the way we describe below.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem is to create a temporary admin account. Ideally the admin account would be time limited, removing itself after a week or so, and not be able to edit users (so that the master admin account stays active). Thankfully there's a plugin that does just this.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/temporary-login-without-password/">Temporary login with password</a> allows you to quickly create temporary accounts, that will automatically expire - keeping your websites data safe.</p>

<p>To use the plugin you should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Go to the WordPress plugin admin, and add a new plugin.</li>
	<li>Search for 'Temporary Login Without Password', and install then activate the plugin made by StoreApps.</li>
	<li>Once active go to the <em>Users > Temporary Logins</em> page. From here you can create new temporary users.</li>
	<li>Click <em>'Create New'</em> and enter an email address (for support from us use <em>support@prothemedesign.com</em>). We recommend using the Admin level, and a week for the duration. A lower level will mean we can't change all of the theme settings, and a shorter duration means we may not be able to fix any further issues that arise (or you will need to create more accounts).</li>
	<li>Once the account has been created you will be given a copy of the login link which you can send to us via a <a href="<?php echo path( '/contact/' ); ?>">support request</a>.</li>
</ol>
