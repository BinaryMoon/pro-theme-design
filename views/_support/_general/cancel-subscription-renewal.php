<p>Our Theme Club subscriptions are handled by Fastspring, a third party payment provider.</p>

<p>In order to cancel your subscription you should visit the <a href="https://prothemedesign.onfastspring.com/account">Pro Theme Design page on Fastspring</a>, and add your purchase email address. They will then send you your account login details so that you can view and edit your subscription settings. This includes cancelling the renewals.</p>

<p class="note icon"><?php draw_svg( 'alert-info', 'large' ); ?>If you cancel your subscription your theme will continue to work but you will no longer receive theme updates, or customer support. Unfortunately we can not guarantee our themes will continue indefinitely. When WordPress updates theme features may stop working.</p>
