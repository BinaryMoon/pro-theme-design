<p class="intro">Unfortunately themes are not downloadable from WordPress.com - if you wish to use a theme on a self hosted website then you should buy one of our themes from <a href="<?php echo path( 'themes/wordpress.org/' ); ?>">our site</a>.</p>

<p>If you've already purchased the theme from WordPress.com then you can't transfer it. This is a standard part of the WordPress.com policy that is mentioned on the <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/premium-themes/">WordPress.com premium theme information page</a>.</p>

<p>If you have purchased your theme in the last 30 days on WordPress.com then you can <a href=" http://en.support.wordpress.com/my-upgrades/refunds/">find out how to get a refund here</a>.</p>

<h2>Guided Transfer</h2>

<p>WordPress.com offer a <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/guided-transfer/">Guide Transfer</a> service. This is a service that will help you, install WordPress, and move your website data to another web host. Please note that the Guided Transfer service does not include transferring premium themes.</p>

<h2>Self Transfer</h2>

<p>If you have the technical know-how then it's relatively easy to transfer the content of your site from WordPress.com to a self hosted site. There's <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-properly-move-your-blog-from-wordpress-com-to-wordpress-org/">a tutorial on transferring WordPress on WPBeginner</a>.</p>
