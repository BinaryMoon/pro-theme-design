<p class="intro">Themes are not downloadable from WordPress.com - if you wish to use a theme on a self hosted website then you should buy one of our themes from <a href="https://creativemarket.com/BinaryMoon?u=BinaryMoon">Creative Market</a> or <a href="<?php echo path( 'theme-club/' ); ?>">join the theme club</a>.</p>

<p>If you've already purchased the theme from wordpress.com then you can't transfer it. This is a standard part of the WordPress.com policy that is mentioned on the <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/premium-themes/">WordPress.com premium theme information page</a>.</p>

<p>If you have purchased your theme in the last 30 days on wordpress.com then you can <a href=" http://en.support.wordpress.com/my-upgrades/refunds/">find out how to get a refund here</a>.</p>
