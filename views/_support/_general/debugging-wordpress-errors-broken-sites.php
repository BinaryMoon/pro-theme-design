<p class="intro">
	We try as hard as we can to make sure our themes are bug free and secure, however it's hard to plan for everything and sometimes things can go wrong. If that happens, then hopefully this guide will help you to fix the problem.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to debug problems is to follow a series of steps.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Check documentation and FAQ's</strong>. Make sure the error you are seeing isn't a known problem or a setting that has been changed recently.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Make sure everything is up to date</strong>. WordPress, your theme, and your plugins. Sometimes (rarely, but it can happen) WordPress changes things in an update which can break themes and plugins. Good theme authors (such as me :)) will fix these bugs as quickly as possible - so make sure you are fully up to date.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Check for plugin conflicts</strong>. If you have recently installed a new plugin, try disabling it and see if the problem goes away. If it does then that's where the problem lies. If you haven't then disable all plugins and see if the problem goes away. If it does then re-enable all plugins one by one until the problem reoccurs. You now have your culprit.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Why go through these steps?</h3>

<p>
	Technically you could just ask for help. That's what you've paid for afterall. However there are a couple of reasons for trying to solve the problem yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Firstly, these steps are the same steps I will reply back with if you ask for help. I will need to make sure everything is up to date, and that there are no plugin conflicts to make sure that the problem is with the theme and not somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, it's probably quicker. As much as I would like to answer immediately (and I do answer as soon as possible) I can only be online a certain amount of hours each day - so if you can solve the problem yourself you won't have to wait for me.
</p>

<h2>Submitting a Support Request</h2>

<p>
	You've gone through the steps above and the problem is still happening. So it's time to contact me. Below are some guidelines to make the process quicker.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Tell me which theme you have, the website url, and where you purchased it - ideally with some form of purchase reference. I need to be able to see the problem to be able to offer help.
	</li>
	<li>
		Tell me what the problem is, what you are expecting to happen (if it's not clear), and what you have tried to do to fix it (if anything).
	</li>
	<li>
		Tell me your technical level. Are you a programming genius or a technical novice. I can then tailor the help to you.
	</li>
	<li>
		In some cases it might be useful to give me a <a href="<?php echo path( '/documentation/general/support-account/' ); ?>">temporary login to your WordPress admin</a>. I will ask if this is needed, but if the problem is with the admin then you could send that along in the initial request to save time.
	</li>
</ul>
