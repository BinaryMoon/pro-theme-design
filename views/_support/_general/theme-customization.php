If you want to cust­o­mize the Black Walnut theme a little further and you need to change the code in the styleeheet (style.css) or in any of the theme tem­plate files, please con­sider crea­ting a child theme for your changes. Using a child theme is quite easy and saves all your indi­vi­dual changes from being over ­written by a future update of the Black Walnut parent theme. You can find more infor­ma­tion on crea­ting a child theme in the article “WordPress Child Theme Basics” on the Themeshaper blog.
