<h2>Theme Customization Service</h2>

<p>We have partnered with <a href="https://codeable.io/?ref=OJHe0">Codeable.io</a> so that they can fulfill your customization needs. Just fill out the <a href="<?php echo path( 'theme-customization/' ); ?>">Theme Customization</a> request form and they will get back to you with a quote.</p>

<h2>Custom Colours and Fonts</h2>

<p>We have developed a simple plugin, called <a href="<?php echo path( 'documentation/plugin/styleguide/' ); ?>">Styleguide</a>, that helps you to modify fonts in all of our themes, and colours in some of them (we plan to support colours in all of them in the future).</p>

<h2>Custom CSS</h2>

<p>If you have knowledge of CSS then the best option is to use the <a href="<?php echo path( 'documentation/feature/custom-css/' ); ?>">Custom CSS</a> module of Jetpack to make CSS changes to your theme.</p>

<h2>Child Theme</h2>

<p>If you are an advanced developer then creating a WordPress child theme is the best option. Doing this allows you to override php files, enqueue new css and javascript, and generally change the theme without worrying about breaking the theme. There's a good post on <a href="http://themeshaper.com/2009/04/17/wordpress-child-theme-basics/">Theme Shaper about child theme basics</a> that should get you started.</p>
