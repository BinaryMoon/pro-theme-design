<p class="intro">Unfortunatately Pro Theme Design themes do not have automatic theme updates. If you see a theme update for one of our themes in your dashboard then do not run the update - it will break your website.</p>

<p>We are considering ways to allow automatic theme updates however, since we only sell through Creative Market, there is currently no way for us to make this work. If we do manage to work out a way to update themes automatically then we will let all of our customers know.</p>
