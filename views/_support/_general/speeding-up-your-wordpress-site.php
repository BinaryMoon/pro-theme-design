<h2>Why is a fast site so important?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Google takes site speed into account when ranking sites. A faster site means a better rank.</li>
    <li>Users like a fast site. A study found that </li>

<h2>Use a Caching Plugin</h2>

<p>Accessing your website normally requires looking up information in a database, structuring it, and then displaying it. This can be slow, especially for large or popular sites. As such we recommend using a caching plugin.</p>

<p>Caching plugins generally create a page using the database information, and then store it in a text file. Future visitors then load the text file rather than doing the complex database operations. The text file gets cleared when new content is published.</p>

<p>The most popular caching plugins are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hyper-cache/" target="_blank">Hyper Cache</a> - the simplest plugin with the least settings.</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/" target="_blank">WP Super Cache</a> - a good middle ground plugin with a nice balance of settings and simplicity.</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/" target="_blank">W3 Total Cache</a> - by far the most complex, and also most powerful of the three. Designed for experts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optimise Your Images</h2>

<p>Images can add a lot to your websites file size. We recommend making use of the <a href="<?php echo path( '/documentation/feature/image-resizing/' ); ?>">Jetpack plugin and Photon functionality</a>. This adds a cdn to your site - essentially serving the images for you from their servers designed to serve images quickly. They will also compress the images making them smaller in size. Both of these things will make your website faster.</p>

<p>Alternatively there are a variety of plugins that will compress your images as you upload them. Some good ones include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" target="_blank">WP Smush.it</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/" target="_blank">EWWW Image Optimizer</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/prizm-image/" target="_blank">Prizm Image</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Note: When switching themes you will generally find that thumbnail sizes will change. To fix this we recommend the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/" target="_blank">Regenerate Thumbnails Plugin</a>.</p>

<h2>A Good Webhost</h2>

<p>When it comes to web hosts - you get what you pay for. If you are paying a small amount for your hosting then you will likely be ok in the early days, but the bigger your sites gets the more problems you will have.</p>

<p>The issue is that really cheap web hosts squash a lot of websites onto a single server. The more sites that are on the server, the slower your own website will get.</p>

<p>This, however, doesn't mean you have to pay loads to get good hosting. Below are a few hosts we recommend.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?70978">Dreamhost</a> - use the coupon code <strong>PTD</strong> when you sign up to save $15 and get a free domain name! We highly recommend the managed WordPress hosting.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d4442740ec05" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a> - Digital Ocean requires some extra technical knowhow - but their servers are super fast, and very cheap for the power.</li>
</ul>
