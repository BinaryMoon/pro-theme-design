<p class="intro">Our themes are available to be used as you wish, however we also offer auto updates. For these to work you will need a Theme License Key.</p>

<p>The license keys can be found in your Gumroad receipt email, and your Gumroad customer account. If you purchased a theme through Creative Market, or do not have a license key then please see below.</p>

<p>License keys are automatically available for all <strong>themes purchased via Gumroad after 12th July 2016</strong>. Customers who have purchased a theme before this date should get a proof of purchase and then <a href="<?php echo path( 'contact/' ); ?>">contact us</a> and we will send a license key to you.</p>
