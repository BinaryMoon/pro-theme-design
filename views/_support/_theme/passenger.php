<h2>Custom Post Formats</h2>

<p>Passenger supports some of the available Post Formats, and styles each differently on the blog, archive, and search pages. Using the different formats will visually distinguish your types of content.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Standard</strong> — The default blog post format displays the content as a news article, with an optional featured image positioned on the left.</li>
	<li><strong>Image</strong> — The image post format displays a large featured image and the post title. Posts with the image format need a featured image assigned to display properly.</li>
	<li><strong>Video</strong> — The video post format will display your video and the post title. It supports YouTube, Vimeo, and hosted videos; and the theme will automatically display the first video that’s added to the post content.</li>
	<li><strong>Gallery</strong> — Gallery posts will display a gallery of images from the gallery you’ve added to the post content.</li>
	<li><strong>Quote</strong> — The quote post format will highlight the first blockquote found in your blog post. If there’s no blockquote, then it will display the entire blog post.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Sidebars</h2>

<p>Passenger has 2 optional sidebars. They will only display if they contain widgets.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Footer Widgets</strong> - this displays in the footer and uses javascript to intelligently position the widgets to make sure they fit together nicely.</li>
	<li><strong>Overlay Widgets</strong> - this is an optional sidebar that will display in a page overlay, accessed from the menu button next to the site title.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Custom Templates</h2>

<p>Passenger has a contributor custom page template. This template lists all of the contributors to your website sorted based on how many posts each person has published. Great for magazines and other multi-author blogs.</p>
