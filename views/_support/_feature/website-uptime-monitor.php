<p class="intro">Knowing that your website is online is really important. With Jetpack Monitor we have a really easy way to tell if it's online or not.</p>

<p>Enable Monitor and it will email you when your website goes offline, and when it comes back online again. getting these notices can be really helpful since you can contact your web host if something goes wrong (or solve the problem yourself).</p>

<p>Receiving the emails also means you will have records of the down time your site gets - and if it's too much then you can contact your web host for some compensation, or simply move elsewhere.</p>
