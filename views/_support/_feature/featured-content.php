<p class="intro">A number of Pro Theme Design themes support Featured Content. This is special content, that you select, that is given a special treatment to make it stand out more. Each theme behaves differently but often the Featured Content will be used to display the content in a slider/ carousel.</p>

<img src="<?php echo image_path( 'docs/feature-featured-content.png' ); ?>" alt="Featured Content in the WordPress Customizer" class="align-right" />

<p>Featured Content often looks best when used with <?php echo documentation_link( 'featured-image' ); ?>.</p>

<p>To set up Featured Content:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Install the <a href="<?php echo JETPACK; ?>">Jetpack plugin</a></li>
	<li>Go to <em>Appearance → Customize → Featured Content</em></li>
	<li>Enter a tag name for the featured posts — make sure the tag is unique and isn’t used anywhere else on your site</li>
	<li>Edit the posts that you want to display in the Featured Content area and give them the featured tag you have just selected</li>
</ol>
