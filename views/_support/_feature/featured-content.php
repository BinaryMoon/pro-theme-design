<p class="intro">A number of Pro Theme Design themes support Featured Content. This is special content, that you select, that gets treated in slightly differently. Each theme behaves differently but often the Featured Content will be used to display the content in a slider/ carousel.</p>

<p>To set up Featured Content:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go Appearance → Customize → Featured Content</li>
    <li>Enter a tag name for the featured posts — make sure the tag is unique and isn’t used anywhere else on your site</li>
    <li>Edit the posts that you want to display in the Featured Content area and give them the featured tag you have just selected</li>
</ol>
