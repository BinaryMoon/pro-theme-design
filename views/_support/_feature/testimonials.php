<p class="intro">Testimonials act as Social Proof - showing that your products or services help the your customers. They're a great way to convince others that your service is the best.</p>

<h2>Adding Testimonials to your site</h2>

<p>Testimonials functionality requires the Jetpack plugin to be installed and enabled. Once done you can enable a unique Testimonial content type to help organize your testimonials in a special section of your dashboard.</p>

<p>You can do this in two simple steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In your site’s dashboard, go to Settings → Writing → Your Custom Content Types and make sure the “Testimonials” option is checked.</li>
    <li>Add testimonials under the new Testimonials menu item in your sidebar.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you’ve added some testimonials, they’ll be visible on your website by visiting http://yoursite.com/testimonial/.</p>
