<p class="intro">Testimonials act as Social Proof - showing that your products or services help the your customers. They're a great way to convince others that your service is the best.</p>

<h2>Adding Testimonials to your site</h2>

<p>Testimonials functionality requires the <a href="<?php echo JETPACK; ?>">Jetpack plugin</a> to be installed and enabled. Once done you can enable a unique Testimonial content type to help organize your testimonials in a special section of your dashboard.</p>

<p>You can do this in two simple steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>In your site’s dashboard, go to Settings → Writing → Your Custom Content Types and make sure the “Testimonials” option is checked.</li>
	<li>Add testimonials under the new Testimonials menu item in your sidebar.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you’ve added some testimonials, they’ll be visible on your website by visiting https://yoursite.com/testimonial/.</p>

<h2>Adding and Editing Testimonials</h2>

<p>Adding a new Testimonial is done through Testimonials &rarr; Add New. The testimonial will be the post content, the title will be used as the name of the person/ company who gave the testimonial, and the featured image will be used as an icon for the person/ company who gave the testimonial.</p>

<h2>Testimonial Shortcode</h2>

<p>Testimonials also come with a shortcode to let you easily display testimonials on posts and pages. <em>[testimonials]</em> embeds an archive view of your testimonials. Full properties and parameters are available on the <a href="https://support.wordpress.com/testimonials/testimonials-shortcode/">Testimonials Shortcode documentation</a>.</p>
