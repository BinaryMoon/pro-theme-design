    <p class="intro">Passenger brings elements of scrapbooking to the digital realm. Everything from fonts to featured image styles helps give your content a more handmade feel, while preserving a modern, minimal aesthetic.</p>

    <p>Passenger is great for travel journals and diaries; it’s also well-suited for a company blog with a focus on arts and crafts or other creative media.</p>

    <p>The theme supports Portfolio and Testimonial post types, so you can also use the theme to showcase other types of creative work.</p>

    <h2>Your Design, Everywhere</h2>

    <p>We designed Passenger to look good on all devices – from desktop computers and laptops to smartphones and tablets.</p>

    <h2>Post Formats</h2>

    <p>Passenger supports several post formats: image, video, gallery, and quote. Each format has a unique style for the blog, archive and search pages. This adds visual interest to your content, and helps you tell your stories more clearly.</p>

    <h2>Custom Headers and Backgrounds</h2>

    <p>Passenger lets you upload your own header image via Customize → Header. You can also personalize your site with a background color or image by going to Customize → Colors & Backgrounds.</p>

    <h2>Widget Areas</h2>

    <p>Passenger has two widget areas where you can add different tools and content to your site. All widget areas will stay hidden until you add widgets to them.</p>


    <ul>
        <li><strong>Overlay widget area</strong> – This area displays on all pages in an overlay that is accessed by clicking the ellipsis (three dots) in the top-right corner of your website.</li>
        <li><strong>Footer widget area</strong> – This area displays at the bottom of every page on the site.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Contributors Template</h2>

    <p>Passenger includes a Contributors template, which will list all of the authors on your website, sorted by how many posts each person has published. It’s great for magazines and other multi-author blogs.</p>
