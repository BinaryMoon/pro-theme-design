    <p class="intro">Monet is a delicate, responsive portfolio theme ideal for showcasing photography, design, and other visuals-rich work. Its crisp typography ensures that your text looks just as appealing as your images.</p>

    <p>Monet is perfect for portfolios, travel and food blogs, or any other image-heavy site.</p>

    <h2>A Versatile Theme</h2>

    <p>While Monet was designed for artists and photographers to showcase their work, it’s equally suitable for bloggers, scrapbookers, and writers who want to add a bit of visual flair to their site.</p>

    <h2>Your Design, Everywhere</h2>

    <p>Monet will look great on all devices — from desktop computers and laptops to smartphones and tablets.</p>

    <h2>Custom Post Formats</h2>

    <p>When you assign a Custom Post Format to a post, the theme will overlay a related icon on the post’s archive listing. This lets your readers know what type of content to expect from each item.</p>

    <h2>Post Slider</h2>

    <p>Monet includes support for featured content — allowing you to showcase the most important work, photos, or blog posts on your site. The five most recent posts tagged as featured content will be displayed in a slider on the homepage.</p>

    <h2>Custom Header and Background</h2>

    <p>Monet lets you upload your own header image via <em>Appearance → Customize → Header</em>. You can also customize your blog with a background color or image by going to Appearance → Customize → Colors & Backgrounds.</p>

    <h2>Widget Areas</h2>

    <p>Monet uses a series of custom sidebars to allow you to keep things flexible. All widget areas will stay hidden unless you add widgets to them.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Footer widget area</strong> — displays at the bottom of every page on the site.
</li>
        <li><strong>Right sidebar widget area</strong> — displays on single posts and pages, but not the homepage or archive pages.
</li>
    </ul>

    <h2></h2>Contributors Page Template

    <p>Monet includes the one custom page template. The Contributors Template creates a list of all of the contributors to your website sorted according to the number of posts each person has published. This feature is great for magazines and other multi-author blogs.</p>
