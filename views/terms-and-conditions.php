			<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

			<h2 id="policy-support">Support</h2>

			<p>To support our themes we have put together comprehensive <a href="<?php echo path( '/documentation/theme/' ); ?>">documentation</a> and built <a href="<?php echo path( '/documentation/' ); ?>">a knowledgebase</a> for our products. If your questions are not answered in the docs then please use the support methods outlined below.</p>

			<p>For WordPress.com support please use the <a href="https://premium-themes.forums.wordpress.com">premium themes forum</a>.</p>

			<p>For self hosted themes you can use our <a href="<?php echo path( 'contact/' ); ?>">contact page</a>.</p>

			<p>For email support we aim to reply with 2 business days.</p>

			<p>Theme support is offered to all users with a valid theme club subscription.</p>

			<p>The support we offer is restricted to fixing bugs in our themes. Unfortunately we don't help with theme modifications/ customizations or installation issues. For help with customizations we have partnered with Codeable who offer <a href="<?php echo path( 'theme-customization/' ); ?>">customization services for WordPress websites</a>.</p>

			<p>We do not offer support for problems with third party plugins or theme modifications.</p>

			<p>We do not offer phone support.</p>

			<p>To help clarify this policy we have put together a support document explaining <a href="<?php echo path( 'documentation/general/support-vs-customization/' ); ?>">the differences between support and customization</a>.</p>

			<h2>License</h2>

			<p>All of our products are licensed under the same license as WordPress, the GPL â€“ there is more information on the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/GPL">GPL license</a> available on the WordPress Codex. Support for Pro Theme Design products will only be given to those who purchase a Pro Theme Design product.</p>

			<h2>Multiple Sites</h2>

			<p>You are welcome to use our themes on as many sites as you like.</p>

			<h2>Product Updates</h2>

			<p>We do not schedule, or guarantee, product updates however we do update products. Updates are included for one year after the date of purchase. To continue receiving updates you will need to purchase a new theme license to continue to receive updates. Occassionally we will release a major update to a product and we reserve the right to charge an upgrade fee at our discretion.</p>

			<p>We publish a list of <a href="<?php echo path( 'tools/changelogs/' ); ?>">all theme changelogs</a>.</p>

			<p>After a period of one year from the date of purchase your license will expire. You are welcome to continue using your purchased theme however support and updates will no longer be guaranteed.</p>

			<h2>Personal Information</h2>

			<p>During the auto update process we may send information such as the website url, WordPress version, and theme version to our servers. This is purely for our internal use. Some information, such as the website url, is neccessary for the update to work. The WordPress and PHP versions are used so that we know what technology our customers use so that we can better serve you.</p>

			<p>We do not transfer any personal information such as email addresses. We will never share this information with anyone.</p>

			<h2>Theme License Keys</h2>

			<p>For Theme Auto Updates to work you will need a valid license. Themes can work without a license, however the Auto Updates will not run.</p>

			<p>We reserve the right to stop the use of Theme License Keys at any time without notice.</p>

			<p>If we withdraw a Theme License Key then your theme will continue to work, however you will no longer receive theme updates.</p>

			<h2>Refunds</h2>

			<p>We offer a 30 day refund Guarantee on all purchases at Pro Theme Design. The only thing we ask is that you explain why, so that we can improve things for future customers. There's more information on this on our <a href="https://prothemedesign.com/documentation/general/refunds/">refund documentation</a>.</p>
			<h2>Transferring themes from WordPress.com</h2>

			<p>Unfortunately themes purchased on WordPress.com are separate products and so are non transferable. This is detailed on the <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/themes/premium-themes/">premium theme terms on WordPress.com</a>. If you wish to move from WordPress.com to a self hosted site then you will need to repurchase your theme.</p>
