<p class="intro">Many people think that people who work on the web have it easy. They think that we sit on the computer all day, noodling on the internet - occassionaly writing a bit of code or drawing a pretty picture. And for some this may be true - but many know that actually working on the web is a hard task. It can be physically, mentally, and emotionally draining. And many times it can be thankless. You can work long hours and weekends and nobody cares as long as the website is online.</p>

I've worked in teams that have 'on call phones', where business phones were bought for top employees - ostensibly as a perk - but also so they could be called at all hours of the day and night. I've worked on projects that entered crunch time - working 80 hours a week to finish a major website rebuild. I've single handedly completed a redesign for a site that had millions of page views a day.

These projects have taken their toll. I now work for myself and rarely even consider working for hire. I am fortunate that I'm in a position where I can work without a direct boss (my customers are the ones in charge ðŸ˜€). This has made me a happier person. I'm fortunate to find myself in a situation where I can do what I want when I want - however there are a number of things I have learnt over these many projects that I think will help anyone to be happier at work.

<div class="note">A lot of the tips from the 'How to Earn More as a Freelance Developer' apply to well being as well. If you earn more, and remove toxic clients - then you will be a lot happier and have more time for yourself.</div>

## Say No More

This can be hard but it's really important to know when to say no to things. As a business person, in particular when you're working as a freelancer - the inclination is to always please the person paying you. However you should always be ready to say no.

You need to say no when a client asks you to make 'one small change'. Often these 'one' small things, are the first 'one' of many 'ones'.

You need to say no when a client says they have no budget. There's plenty of cheap/ free services online that will serve them better - and taking free jobs devalues you in the eyes of your employer. The less a client is willing to pay the more trouble they are likely to be, asking you to do crazy things.

You need to say no to projects for 'exposure' - generally clients that offer this have no exposure to offer.

You need to say no when you're being asked to do things that will negatively affect a project. Working on things like this can be incredibly demoralizing.

Of course there's always exceptions to these things. Sometimes it's ok to do them, and you will need to make that call.
