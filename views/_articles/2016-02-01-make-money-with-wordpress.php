<p class="intro">WordPress is an incredibly versatile application, and there are many ways to make money with it. On this page I have listed the most common, but I'm sure it's not an exhaustive list. If you know of any others then please do let us know on Twitter.</p>

<h2>Blogging</h2>

<p>Blogging is what WordPress was built for. Since it's birth WordPress has changed a lot and it can now do so much more, but it's original purpose was blogging, so let's start there.</p>

<p>Creating a popular blog is a challenge all on it's own - but if you can manage it then there are three good ways to monetise your now popular site.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Advertising</strong> - oldschool, but easy to get in to. The prevalence of ad blockers means this is becoming less lucrative than it once was.</li>
    <li><strong>Affiliate Marketing</strong> - Find awesome products, and then promote them. Make sure to use an affiliate url, and then you'll earn money from each person who buys from your link.</li>
    <li><strong>Sponsored Posts</strong> - many companies will pay bloggers to write about their products and services.</li>
</ol>

<p>Beware of selling links. If you don't list the link as 'nofollow' then you may end up being penalised by Google. This practice has been frowned upon for some time now but there are still companies trying to sell them.</p>

<p>If you're in the market for a new blogging theme then our most popular are <a href="<?php echo path( 'theme/opti/' ); ?>">Opto</a>, and <a href="<?php echo path( 'theme/monet/' ); ?>">Monet</a>.</p>

<h2>Advertising Your Business</h2>

<p>The alternative to blogging is simply to use WordPress to advertise your existing business. It doesn't matter what your business is or what you do - all companies should have a web presense as for many searching online is the first place they go when looking for a solution. If you're not online, you're going to make less money.</p>

<p class="note tip">If you're creating a website for your bricks and mortar store then make sure to include your shop address on the site. This will make it easy for people to find you - and also it will tell Google where you are, so that it can be relevant for local searches.</p>

<p>A good example of a business theme is <a href="<?php echo path( 'theme/exhibit/' ); ?>">Exhibit</a>.</p>

<h2>Web Design &amp; Development Services</h2>

<p>If you're an awesome web designer then creating websites for others is an obvious next step.</p>

<p>There are many web design companies and agencies that make a lot of money creating websites for people from scratch.</p>

<p>There is also a growing trend towards 'implementors' people who buy ready made themes from sites like <a href="https://prothemedesign.com">Pro Theme Design</a>, or <a href="https://creativemarket.com/?u=BinaryMoon">Creative Market</a>, and then customise them for clients. This is a great starting point for less technical people who don't want to build a site from scratch but know enough html and css to tweak a site to meet a clients needs.</p>

<h2>Site Maintenance</h2>

<p>Many people have an existing site and need it to be maintained. For instance they might want backups, or tweaks to the existing site, installing plugins, optimizing servers, or help with optimising their sales. There's loads of things an experienced web developer could offer that would be relatively easy for them to do - and incrdibly useful for their customers.</p>

<p>For many this could be an add-on service to the <em>Web Design and Development Services</em> mentioned above. Once you have built a customers website why not offer them a monthly maintanence package? For a small monthly fee you would update their software and plugins, and backup their site.</p>

<p>This could add some recurring revenue with little additional work - and would be a great way to enahnce the client relationship for future projects.</p>

<h2>Teaching Services</h2>

<p>People need to learn, and if you're highly skilled at something then sharing your knowledge can be a great way to earn money. Some of the thing syou could do include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Creating a blog that teaches people your skills - and then hiring yourself out to give 1 to 1 tuition and advice. <a href="https://chrislema.com/">Chris Lema</a> has been doing great with this by selling time with himself for people to pick his brain (using <a href="http://clarity.fm/">Clarity.fm</a>).</li>
    <li>Writing tutorials and charging for videos or other supplemental content that offers more detailed information and help.</li>
    <li>Creating a subscription site or community, offering some content for free, and more advanced content for money.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note tip"><a href="https://www.woothemes.com/products/sensei/">Sensei</a> is a great plugin for creating online teaching resources in WordPress. It even integrates with WooCommerce so that you can create a paid memberships teaching site.</p>

<h2>Selling Premium Themes and Plugins</h2>

<p>This is super popular. There are loads of theme shops around now, with good reason. I started <a href="https://prothemedesign.com/">Pro Theme Design</a> in 2007, and we're still going strong however we're a long way from the biggest theme shop around.</p>

<p>Last year WooThemes was aquired by Automattic (the company that owns wordpress.com) for an undisclosed amount that's rumoured to be over $30 million. That's a lot of money.</p>

<p>An easier game to get into - for someone starting out - would be plugins. Themes are becoming saturated but there's a lot more scope to make useful good quality plugins. Pippins plugins is one of the top plugin makers out there - creating the popular ecommerce plugin Easy Digital Downloads.</p>

<p>To sell themes and plugins you could try the following marketplaces:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://creativemarket.com/?u=BinaryMoon">Creative Market</a> - for themes, or digital assets</li>
    <li><a href="http://themeforest.net/">ThemeForest</a> - for Themes</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.mojo-themes.com/">Mojo Themes</a> - for themes</li>
    <li><a href="http://codecanyon.net/">CodeCanyon</a> - for plugins</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.mojo-code.com/">Mojo Code</a> - for plugins</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively you could always build and sell the themes/ plugins on your own site. In fact I would always recommend doing this since you will then be the one in control. You can set the prices and you own the customer details.</p>

<p class="note tip">If I was starting now I would create themes and plugins for a specific, underserved, group of users. I would then try to make the ultimate theme for that group of users. This will make marketing much easier.</p>

<h2>Selling Info Products</h2>

<p>If you can build a loyal group of people who love the content you produce then you can create an info product. This would take the form of an ebook/ pdf that people can buy. The ebook would need to go into more detail than your website, and could also include videos or other supplemental data that can't be found anywhere else.</p>

<p>Often less technical people can get scared when you talk about selling things online however there's loads of services out there that do all the work for you. All you have to do is create the content and then upload it to their service. Below are a few popular services that could help you get started:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> - the service I use to sell themes on <a href="https://prothemedesign.com">Pro Theme Design</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://selz.com/">Selz</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://sellfy.com/">Sellfy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want you could also use a WordPress plugin to sell your digital products however I feel that often this is more work. You will still need to set up payment providers, secure certificates, and generally have more to maintain. Of you use a third party service then all you have to do is link to your product on their server. This can work with any type of site (including those powered by wordpress.com).

<p>However, if you want to go down this path and you're hosting WordPress yourself, then the following are some of the top WordPress e-commerce plugins.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">WooCommerce</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/">Easy Digital Downloads</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Website Flipping</h2>

<p>Website flipping is the act of creating (or purchasing) a website, improving it, and then selling it on for profit.</p>

<p>Creating a simple WordPress site, filling it with some content, and then flipping it - is relatively easy for an experienced WordPress developer. However if it's a basic site with no traffic you'll likely not get much back from your investment. What you need to do is build the website into a good property with decent traffic and Google rankings (and ideally income), and that's when the big money can begin.</p>

<p>The most popular place for selling websites is <a href="http://flippa.com">Flippa</a>. You can find all sorts of sites on their - including some that you might consider bargains.</p>

<p>The alternative is to search through Flippa and find sites you think you can bring value too - and buy them. You will then have a pre-existing site that you can enhance.</p>

<h2>Content Writing Services</h2>

<p>Blogging isn't for everyone. Many people understand the power of a blog, but don't enjoy writing, or simply don't have the time for writing. That's where content writing services come in.</p>

<p>Good copywriting can make an ok looking website an amazing resource - and so there's a big market for quality writing. This is a great way for less technical people to become involved in WordPress.</p>

<p>Another area of content writing services that you could try is proof reading and content editing. There's a lot of content around that makes a compelling story, but is poorly written and so finding clients who need help with this sort of thing can also make a big difference to the perception of a website.</p>
